This branch is to track my progress throughout the project
I Just learned what Git was and what github is and how to make Reprositories
I will be uploading a condensed version of my note files! 
 
Hey again Git its me im making this message to jog my memory on how to commit 
and use git! :X

3rd day checking on git making sure i know how to use it!

Also yesterday i learned what html tags and elements are and created my first 
text on a web page, obviousally i can't show it because i dont have hosting 
or anything however i now understand how to tile using the <title> tags
the <head> tags and what to use as the deafault (meta charset UTF-8 tag) 
here is an example from memory:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset=UTF-8>
<title> this is my website!</title>
</head>
<body>
this is the first body :D
</body>
</html>

this is the 4th time i am uploading and commiting to git from memory i've been learning new elements about HTML from the odin project like <p> <strong> <head> etc. im going to be completely honest though i didnt practice as much as id like because of christmas and helping cook but thats not an excuse just my honesty and me being a bit lazy and tired. still though im going to continue working and as i do really enjoy programming! Another thing to add is im currently learning to use vim in the cli i went through the free part of "vim adventures" and found out it was 25$ i didn't know that so ill just learn by trial however it was still a cook little game. anyways thats it for today ill update more later tonight!

This is my 5th commit to git just making sure i know how to from memory still got it! im going to reformmating the repo and tracking my practice more concisely.
so far today ive figured out how to properly write a commit message and why they are important.
