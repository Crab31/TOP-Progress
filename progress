Hey again Git its me im making this message to jog my memory on how to commit 
and use git! :X

3rd day checking on git making sure i know how to use it!

Also yesterday i learned what html tags and elements are and created my first 
text on a web page, obviousally i can't show it because i dont have hosting 
or anything however i now understand how to tile using the <title> tags
the <head> tags and what to use as the deafault (meta charset UTF-8 tag) 
here is an example from memory:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset=UTF-8>
<title> this is my website!</title>
</head>
<body>
this is the first body :D
</body>
</html>
